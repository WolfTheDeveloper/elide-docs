# API Documentation

The latest API docs from the main [Elide repo](https://github.com/elide-dev/elide) are archived here, so they may be built with the docs site, and included in the output that is uploaded to hosting.

## Contributing to the API Docs

The API docs are built automatically with [Dokka](https://github.com/Kotlin/dokka/). See the main Elide repo for directions to build the API docs.
